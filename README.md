### Title of the Project
This project aims to address challenges by developing a comprehensive solution for detecting and analyzing suspicious files and processes on computer systems.

### About
This project is designed to work on Windows systems, utilizing Windows-specific libraries such as psutil and WMI for gathering and analyzing process and network data. It focuses on monitoring active processes and network connections to detect suspicious activities, without extending to full system-wide monitoring. The use of Python allows flexibility and seamless integration with external APIs and libraries to enhance functionality.

### Features
Identify and Monitor Running Processes on a System.
Capture Network Details Associated with These Processes.
Analyze the Collected Data to Detect Suspicious Activities.
Verify Suspicious IP Addresses Against VirusTotal and AbuseIPDB.

### Requirements
Operating System: Requires a 64-bit OS (Windows 10 or Ubuntu) for compatibility with deep learning frameworks.
Development Environment: Python 3.6 or later is necessary for coding the sign language detection system.
Deep Learning Frameworks: TensorFlow for model training, MediaPipe for hand gesture recognition.
Image Processing Libraries: OpenCV is essential for efficient image processing and real-time hand gesture recognition.
Version Control: Implementation of Git for collaborative development and effective code management.
IDE: Use of VSCode as the Integrated Development Environment for coding, debugging, and version control integration.
Additional Dependencies: Includes scikit-learn, TensorFlow (versions 2.4.1), TensorFlow GPU, OpenCV, and Mediapipe for deep learning tasks.

### Results and Impact
In conclusion, the Security Posture Evaluation and Threat Intelligence Analysis system we developed using Python demonstrates a significant improvement in real-time threat detection and security monitoring. By integrating advanced machine learning models and threat intelligence feeds, the system is able to accurately identify potential security risks, assess vulnerabilities, and provide actionable insights to strengthen overall security posture. Our implementation offers high accuracy in detecting threats and provides efficient real-time analysis, making it a valuable tool for both small and large-scale security systems.
